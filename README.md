# Image-Mosaicing

## Project Description
Many a time, it is not possible to capture the complete image of a large scene in a single exposure as most of the image capturing media work with images of definite size because of their inherent limit. This project proposes a technique for capturing the complete view using less number of cameras.
Mosaicing is blending together of several arbitrarily shaped images to form one large radiometrically balanced image so that the boundaries between the original images are not seen. Any number of images can be blended together along user-specified cut lines
